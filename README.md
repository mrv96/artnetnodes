# expanseElectronics Artnet Node (gen 2)

**Please select the node generation from the branch menu above.**
**You are currently in the 2nd Generation branch.**


### **About:**
As a lighting technician, I often have to run cables across walkways, moving props, or only awkward places to run a wire. Wouldn't it be nice to have a wireless solution? While there are many commercial units available using various protocols, they are either expensive or unreliable. With our product, you could have any show set up within hours! With its slim and compact design, it fits right in your pocket! With the implementation of Wi-Fi, there is no need to worry about cables. Stored scenes allow for instant playback through the web interface with nearly no latency. 

### **Some demos:**
Before selling these nodes on Tindie, I have used them in many productions thus far. I most recently used the 2nd generation nodes in CUTAZZ’s performance of ‘Synergy’ performed by the CUTAZZ Dance Society at the [(Leys Great Hall)](https://www.theleys.net/591/venue-hire/great-hall) where we used two of our second-generation nodes for two followspots mounted at the rear of the circle. The wireless capabilities came in super useful when the nearest DMX outlet was nearly 20m away. It only took us only a couple of minutes per node to have them all hooked up to our ETC Nomad System.
